Reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/gmr6en/i_made_a_small_app_that_gives_quotes_on_multiple/

Prerequisites:

0. Python
1. BeautifulSoup library
2. PySimpleGUI library
3. Requests library

This is really only useful for beginners like me who are day/swing trading using WealthSimple Trade for small amounts and don't want to pay $12USD to see live quotes on TradeView
